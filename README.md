# Outline

### Day 1:

The focus of this day is to install the core libraries for scientific computing and to learn the basics of working with numpy arrays. Building all the low-level skills that we feel are necessary for interacting with real world problems.

-   Installing python libraries with Andaconda

-   Basic of working in Jupyter notebooks

-   Working with arrays of data (bulk of the day is this)

    -   Shapes of arrays + data types

    -   Performing mathematical operations (e.g. sin, multiply, divide, mean, stddev)

    -   Indexing and selecting data based on conditions (Very important!)

-   Very basic plotting

    -   Plotting mathematical functions 

    -   Use indexing to select only the interesting data points

-   How to troubleshoot

    -   How to google your problems

    -   How to read error messages

-   Application: Simulating a random walk


### Day 2:

Here we start exploring more advanced applications. We will not dwell on the underlying math and instead will focus on the python skills necessary to solve different problems.

-   Writing functions that work on numpy arrays

-   Review of numpy arrays, plotting, and indexing

-   Solving Ordinary Differential Equations


### Day 3:


-   Making high quality plots for presentations, papers, and other means of sharing your work 
-   Introduction to principal component analysis with an application to financial data

After this relatively short day, the instructors will hold a sort of office hour to answer any questions from the course and provide suggestions for any other applications that students have.
